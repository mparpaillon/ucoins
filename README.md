# Universal coins (Ucoins) (WIP)

An humble attempt at creating a Universal currency where everyone gets the same amount at the same pace.

## Core concepts

- 1) There is a fixed amount of this currency and it should be, by design, impossible to create more (like Bitcoins?)
- 2) Being the creator of the currency should not make you richer
- 3) Since all human lives are worth the same, everybody should get the same amount, the same chances.
- 4) No third party should manage this currency (no banks or state) (so... blockchain I guess ?)
- 5) You should be given enough coin everyday to live decently on this planet.

## Potential flaws

### Will we need more than the fixed amount one day, and why ?

## Thoughts

You should receive everyday a fixed amount of coins. This amount should be based on what? The remaining coins? What happens when all the coins are distributed. Do we stop earning coins everyday?

There is 7.6 billion people on this planet today (November 15th 2020). There's about 1 billion more every 12 years or so. What would be the correct amount of coins and why?

Would you get your coins from the day you're born or from a certain age?
Makings tons of babies should not make you richer. That's a tough one I think. If babies start gaining coins then maybe those coins should be blocked until they're 18 or something?

How do we handle fake identities? We need something truly unique to identify people but we don't want to be dependent on the State or anything so... tough one.
DNA could be a solution. But even that can be altered nowadays right? I heard that blood pressure (or smth) was unique too, and maybe easy to transform into an id (thanks to some kind of portable device?).

It shouldn't be possible to steal the coins from someone. Tough one too (maybe even impossible)

Let's imagine a world where we have a device which can take your DNA/BloodPressure/FingerPrint/Anything, create an id (private key) then transform it into a kind of QR code tatooed/printed on the skin or something. We would be able to buy stuff by scanning the QR code but some bad people would chop off your arm just to use your coins. We should make sure that, by design, this is not an option. We don't want to provoke this kind of behaviors.

Maybe there should be a device like an ATM where you could go to credit the new amount of coins since the last time you withdrawed. This would need your id to work (DNA/BloodPressure/FingerPrint/Anything).

So, let's say a human being gets 500 coins per day. The last time Janet withdrawed coins was a week ago. So she goes to the ATM-like device, use her id, choose how many days of "revenue" she wants to withdraw (from 1 to 7, since it's been a week). Pick 3, gets credited 1500 coins. She can now use this amount everywhere. If bad people try to steal her, they will only be able to steal the amount she's holding (so 3 days worth of revenue). If the id is based on the DNA, they might be tempted to chop off the arm and keep the DNA (I don't know much about that but that sounds doable...). So maybe the "Blood pressure" id would be the best option since there would be none on a chopped off arm. The only way to steal all the money from someone would to keep their hostage and withdraw everyday their coins. Not the simplest thing to do I guess.
